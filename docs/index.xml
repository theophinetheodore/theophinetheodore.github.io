he does the video stuff, lighting, editing and all.&lt;br>
for now, i just do the subtitling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i used to use kdenlive&amp;rsquo;s speech recognition feature that uses vosk under the hood.&lt;br>
now they have also added support for whisper, but it&amp;rsquo;s the python one.&lt;br>
it needs torch, numba and some stuff like that - i have no idea.&lt;br>
so anyway, it errored out.&lt;br>
it said it required python versions between 3.9-3.13.&lt;br>
but i have 3.13.5.&lt;br>
i mean, bruh.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>my current blog "setup".</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/my-current-blog-setup./</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/my-current-blog-setup./</guid><description>&lt;p>well, i use &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo&lt;/a> with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tomfran/typo">typo&lt;/a> theme.&lt;br>
i initially wanted to make my own theme, so i yanked &lt;a href="https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/hugo-starter-theme">eric murphy&amp;rsquo;s starter theme&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
but then i realized i don&amp;rsquo;t want to make a whole new theme,&lt;br>
figure everything out,&lt;br>
so i found typo and stuck with it.&lt;br>
i just wanna get started with writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i&amp;rsquo;m using github pages.&lt;br>
since i&amp;rsquo;m using hugo, i looked up ways to host a hugo website in github pages.&lt;br>
and all these blogs have stuff about YAMLs and github actions&lt;br>
and workflows and stuff.&lt;br>
and i was like, nah, man, i don&amp;rsquo;t wanna do this stuff.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>custom domain.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/custom-domain./</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/custom-domain./</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="theophinetheodore.xyz">theophinetheodore.xyz&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>thank you brother!&lt;br>
you are the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>having a custom domain is cool, i guess.&lt;br>
don&amp;rsquo;t have to be tied to the github pages domain,&lt;br>
and github pages in general.&lt;br>
even though i use it now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>nothing more to add.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>fight.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/fight./</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/fight./</guid><description>&lt;p>everyone tells you:&lt;br>
fight your laziness.&lt;br>
fight your lethargy.&lt;br>
fight your despair.&lt;br>
fight your rage.&lt;br>
fight your lack of focus.&lt;br>
fight everything you see as a threat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but here&amp;rsquo;s another approach:&lt;br>
befriend your laziness.&lt;br>
befriend your lethargy.&lt;br>
befriend your despair.&lt;br>
befriend your rage.&lt;br>
befriend your lack of focus.&lt;br>
befriend everything you see as a threat.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>your emotions are not irrational.&lt;br>
if you do something, it has been done for a reason.&lt;br>
rather than fight against yourself&lt;br>
and treat yourself like an enemy,&lt;br>
befriend yourself.&lt;br>
try to understand yourself.&lt;br>
listen to what your parts within you have to say.&lt;br>
soothe them, care for them.&lt;br>
thank them for what they do.&lt;br>
lovingly tell them it could be done better.&lt;br>
if they falter, help them get back up.&lt;br>
treat them with love and respect.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>what my mentor told me about relationships... and then i derail.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/what-my-mentor-told-me-about-relationships./</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/what-my-mentor-told-me-about-relationships./</guid><description>&lt;p>a relationship truly begins when both the man and the woman are completely unburdened and healed and &lt;em>then&lt;/em> choose each other with all their heart.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>what we like, what we don&amp;rsquo;t, what we&amp;rsquo;re scared of - all can be affected by what our parts in us think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>perhaps what we find beautiful and attractive right now, in our burdened states, is not what we&amp;rsquo;d really like if we were guided by the Self.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>my wayland situation.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/wayland/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/wayland/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="heading" id="pros-of-wayland-for-me">

&lt;li>pinch-to-zoom works in chromium based browsers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>waydroid.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>tried doing it in xorg with cage and weston, won&amp;rsquo;t recommend&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>touchpad gestures work.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>i don&amp;rsquo;t have any use for it though&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>things are smoother and brighter? or am i imagining?&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;del>can&amp;rsquo;t paste images in clipboard into chat applications.&lt;/del> (works now ig)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>panels appear stacked on top of each other instead of left, right, center.&lt;/del> (fixed)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gramps crashes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>maim doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. (i need a screenshot tool that returns something other than 0 if it&amp;rsquo;s cancelled, and everything else - flameshot, spectacle returns 0 even if cancelled).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>grim doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in kwin-wayland, because some wlr unstable protocol lacking. (not wlroots&amp;rsquo; fault, but a hundred implementations exist).
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>and who names these tools? i mean, grim, slurp, scrot&amp;hellip; oh my God.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>issues with anydesk and rustdesk.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>no simplescreenrecorder :(
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>well, not a wayland issue, but SSR is just too good&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

we were having food, chatting, joking about random things and stuff.&lt;br>
and then, all of a sudden, we all fell silent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and that&amp;rsquo;s when my brother&amp;rsquo;s filipina wife said,&lt;br>
in the philippines, when a group of people&lt;br>
who were talking suddenly fall silent,&lt;br>
they say it&amp;rsquo;s because an angel just passed by.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i think it&amp;rsquo;s interesting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>my 2-min hyprland adventure.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/my-2-min-hyprland-adventure./</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/my-2-min-hyprland-adventure./</guid><description>&lt;p>well, i have used hyprland and sway in the past for a few weeks, i guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but well, with DHH&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://omarchy.org/">omarchy&lt;/a> and pewdiepie&amp;rsquo;s hyprland setup,&lt;br>
among with many other rices,&lt;br>
let&amp;rsquo;s say it got me intrigued.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>to be honest, i do not care much about the rest,&lt;br>
but I remember seeing a hyprland rice with custom window decorations,&lt;br>
and that was actually wonderful.&lt;br>
i have tried to create a window decoration for KDE plasma,&lt;br>
but it turned out to be quite inflexible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TIL hardwrap.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/til-hardwrap/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/til-hardwrap/</guid><description>&lt;p>i have this writing style of&lt;br>
breaking stuff into lines.&lt;br>
i don&amp;rsquo;t do paragraphs.&lt;br>
i like it this way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but that means i have to run this after i complete writing something:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code class="language-vimscript" data-lang="vimscript">:%s:$: :g
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>that&amp;rsquo;s two spaces.&lt;br>
basically what it does is, add two spaces to the end of every line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i think markdown requires either two spaces,&lt;br>
or a backslash,&lt;br>
or a &lt;code>&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but today i came across this thing called &lt;strong>hardwraps&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"batman begins" - thoughts.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/batman-begins---thoughts./</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/batman-begins---thoughts./</guid><description>&lt;p>revisited &amp;ldquo;batman begins&amp;rdquo; after a years.&lt;br>
was a kid when i watched it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>even since the death of his parents,&lt;br>
young bruce puts the blame on himself.&lt;br>
the thought germinated in his mind as a kid,&lt;br>
and he clung onto it as he grew.&lt;br>
he still bears the guilt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and what he did was bury the guilt with anger.&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;my anger outweighs my guilt&amp;rdquo;, he says.&lt;br>
but ra&amp;rsquo;s al ghul tells him he&amp;rsquo;ll teach bruce to&lt;br>
overcome his guilt by confronting it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"gender politics."</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/gender-politics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/gender-politics/</guid><description>&lt;p>NOTE:&lt;br>
my intention is not to blindly criticize anyone.&lt;br>
we are all humans, the children of God,&lt;br>
and we are all made in the image and likeness of God.&lt;br>
we all deserve good in our lives,&lt;br>
yet we are tormented by our internal and external burdens.&lt;br>
but we should seek to heal ourselves,&lt;br>
and treat each other with compassion.&lt;br>
i believe it&amp;rsquo;s possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>my analysis might be wrong,&lt;br>
but as i engaged in online discourse,&lt;br>
i could see two types of people.&lt;br>
and as far as online discussions go,&lt;br>
the most vocal, heated and extreme viewpoints are shared.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>the psalm of gratitude.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/the-psalm-of-gratitude/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/the-psalm-of-gratitude/</guid><description>&lt;p>everyday feels like a gift from the Lord.&lt;br>
my only qualm is, i do not make much use of it.&lt;br>
yet, every single day feels different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i thought they were joking when they said that&lt;br>
the love of the Lord is different every day.&lt;br>
now i experience it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He saves me from every trouble,&lt;br>
He feeds me,&lt;br>
He protects me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i used to clamor for help,&lt;br>
i used to ask God,&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;God help me, fix this issue of mine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
but i think i downgraded God to a mere miracle-worker,&lt;br>
who would press some buttons and&lt;br>
(trying not to say &amp;ldquo;bada bing bada boom&amp;rdquo;)&lt;br>
hey, issue resolved.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p>but well, with DHH&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://omarchy.org/">omarchy&lt;/a> and pewdiepie&amp;rsquo;s hyprland setup,&lt;br>
among with many other rices,&lt;br>
let&amp;rsquo;s say it got me intrigued.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>to be honest, i do not care much about the rest,&lt;br>
but I remember seeing a hyprland rice with custom window decorations,&lt;br>
and that was actually wonderful.&lt;br>
i have tried to create a window decoration for KDE plasma,&lt;br>
but it turned out to be quite inflexible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TIL hardwrap.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/til-hardwrap/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/til-hardwrap/</guid><description>&lt;p>i have this writing style of&lt;br>
breaking stuff into lines.&lt;br>
i don&amp;rsquo;t do paragraphs.&lt;br>
i like it this way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but that means i have to run this after i complete writing something:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code class="language-vimscript" data-lang="vimscript">:%s:$: :g
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>that&amp;rsquo;s two spaces.&lt;br>
basically what it does is, add two spaces to the end of every line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i think markdown requires either two spaces,&lt;br>
or a backslash,&lt;br>
or a &lt;code>&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but today i came across this thing called &lt;strong>hardwraps&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"batman begins" - thoughts.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/batman-begins---thoughts./</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/batman-begins---thoughts./</guid><description>&lt;p>revisited &amp;ldquo;batman begins&amp;rdquo; after a years.&lt;br>
was a kid when i watched it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>even since the death of his parents,&lt;br>
young bruce puts the blame on himself.&lt;br>
the thought germinated in his mind as a kid,&lt;br>
and he clung onto it as he grew.&lt;br>
he still bears the guilt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and what he did was bury the guilt with anger.&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;my anger outweighs my guilt&amp;rdquo;, he says.&lt;br>
but ra&amp;rsquo;s al ghul tells him he&amp;rsquo;ll teach bruce to&lt;br>
overcome his guilt by confronting it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"gender politics."</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/gender-politics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/gender-politics/</guid><description>&lt;p>NOTE:&lt;br>
my intention is not to blindly criticize anyone.&lt;br>
we are all humans, the children of God,&lt;br>
and we are all made in the image and likeness of God.&lt;br>
we all deserve good in our lives,&lt;br>
yet we are tormented by our internal and external burdens.&lt;br>
but we should seek to heal ourselves,&lt;br>
and treat each other with compassion.&lt;br>
i believe it&amp;rsquo;s possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>my analysis might be wrong,&lt;br>
but as i engaged in online discourse,&lt;br>
i could see two types of people.&lt;br>
and as far as online discussions go,&lt;br>
the most vocal, heated and extreme viewpoints are shared.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>the psalm of gratitude.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/the-psalm-of-gratitude/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/the-psalm-of-gratitude/</guid><description>&lt;p>everyday feels like a gift from the Lord.&lt;br>
my only qualm is, i do not make much use of it.&lt;br>
yet, every single day feels different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i thought they were joking when they said that&lt;br>
the love of the Lord is different every day.&lt;br>
now i experience it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He saves me from every trouble,&lt;br>
He feeds me,&lt;br>
He protects me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i used to clamor for help,&lt;br>
i used to ask God,&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;God help me, fix this issue of mine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
but i think i downgraded God to a mere miracle-worker,&lt;br>
who would press some buttons and&lt;br>
(trying not to say &amp;ldquo;bada bing bada boom&amp;rdquo;)&lt;br>
hey, issue resolved.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

he does the video stuff, lighting, editing and all.&lt;br>
for now, i just do the subtitling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i used to use kdenlive&amp;rsquo;s speech recognition feature that uses vosk under the hood.&lt;br>
now they have also added support for whisper, but it&amp;rsquo;s the python one.&lt;br>
it needs torch, numba and some stuff like that - i have no idea.&lt;br>
so anyway, it errored out.&lt;br>
it said it required python versions between 3.9-3.13.&lt;br>
but i have 3.13.5.&lt;br>
i mean, bruh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>installed whisper-cpp from chaotic-AUR.&lt;br>
got base.en GGML model from huggingface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>stripped the audio from the video file:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -an audio.mp3
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>ran this command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>whisper-cli -m ggml-base.en.bin&lt;span style="color:#666;font-style:italic">\
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#666;font-style:italic">&lt;/span>	-t 1 --max-context 8 -et 2.8&lt;span style="color:#666;font-style:italic">\
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#666;font-style:italic">&lt;/span>	-osrt -f audio.mp3
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>there&amp;rsquo;s now an audio.mp3.srt in the current directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>base.en was pretty fast for my intel core i3.&lt;br>
and output is so much better than vosk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>well, on second glance, i still have to work on the subtitle.&lt;br>
and i don&amp;rsquo;t blame whisper.cpp.&lt;br>
it&amp;rsquo;s that the model gets confused when two people speak at the same time,&lt;br>
and accents can be hard to interpret, even for humans, so.&lt;br>
but it did a good job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>thank you, whisper-cpp devs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>my current blog "setup".</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/my-current-blog-setup./</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/my-current-blog-setup./</guid><description>&lt;p>well, i use &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo&lt;/a> with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tomfran/typo">typo&lt;/a> theme.&lt;br>
i initially wanted to make my own theme, so i yanked &lt;a href="https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/hugo-starter-theme">eric murphy&amp;rsquo;s starter theme&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
but then i realized i don&amp;rsquo;t want to make a whole new theme,&lt;br>
figure everything out,&lt;br>
so i found typo and stuck with it.&lt;br>
i just wanna get started with writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i&amp;rsquo;m using github pages.&lt;br>
since i&amp;rsquo;m using hugo, i looked up ways to host a hugo website in github pages.&lt;br>
and all these blogs have stuff about YAMLs and github actions&lt;br>
and workflows and stuff.&lt;br>
and i was like, nah, man, i don&amp;rsquo;t wanna do this stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then i figured out github pages can fetch the website files&lt;br>
either from the root (/) of the repository or from the docs directory.&lt;br>
so now i just do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code># zoxide shortcut to go the repository, or just cd
z blog

# hugo serves the website and builds it in docs/
# Ctrl-c when over
hugo serve --minify -d docs --buildFuture
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>and then just do the git stuff: adding, committing, pushing.&lt;br>
no need of workflows and stuff.&lt;br>
one less thing to take care of.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>i use &lt;a href="https://obsidian.md">obsidian&lt;/a> to write my notes.&lt;br>
i would like to switch, cause electron.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i tried to find another editor that is nice and simple&lt;br>
and has vim keybindings.&lt;br>
tried other stuff: kwrite, daino notes, ghostwriter, all that.&lt;br>
none of em click.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and writing in neovim with a mono font doesn&amp;rsquo;t cut it anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so i&amp;rsquo;m using obsidian.&lt;br>
but gotta say, obsidian is pretty comfy.&lt;br>
using it with &lt;a href="https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/frontend/fonts/">gitlab sans&lt;/a> typeface and &lt;a href="https://github.com/ZeChArtiahSaher/obsidian-mono-black">mono-black&lt;/a> theme.&lt;br>
i use this combo in every vault of mine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>custom domain.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/custom-domain./</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/custom-domain./</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="theophinetheodore.xyz">theophinetheodore.xyz&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>thank you brother!&lt;br>
you are the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>having a custom domain is cool, i guess.&lt;br>
don&amp;rsquo;t have to be tied to the github pages domain,&lt;br>
and github pages in general.&lt;br>
even though i use it now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>nothing more to add.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>fight.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/fight./</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/fight./</guid><description>&lt;p>everyone tells you:&lt;br>
fight your laziness.&lt;br>
fight your lethargy.&lt;br>
fight your despair.&lt;br>
fight your rage.&lt;br>
fight your lack of focus.&lt;br>
fight everything you see as a threat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but here&amp;rsquo;s another approach:&lt;br>
befriend your laziness.&lt;br>
befriend your lethargy.&lt;br>
befriend your despair.&lt;br>
befriend your rage.&lt;br>
befriend your lack of focus.&lt;br>
befriend everything you see as a threat.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>your emotions are not irrational.&lt;br>
if you do something, it has been done for a reason.&lt;br>
rather than fight against yourself&lt;br>
and treat yourself like an enemy,&lt;br>
befriend yourself.&lt;br>
try to understand yourself.&lt;br>
listen to what your parts within you have to say.&lt;br>
soothe them, care for them.&lt;br>
thank them for what they do.&lt;br>
lovingly tell them it could be done better.&lt;br>
if they falter, help them get back up.&lt;br>
treat them with love and respect.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>maybe some of you might be thinking:&lt;br>
what is this sissy horses***?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>well, if me from 2022 reads this, i&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure he&amp;rsquo;d call this &amp;ldquo;gay&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but trust me, i have been there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the egolifting, the abuse,&lt;br>
the rage-driven squats and bench presses, (often with poor form, i admit)&lt;br>
the burial of emotions in order to strengthen yourself, (that causes more problems)&lt;br>
reading &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t Hurt Me&amp;rdquo; by David Goggins, (nice book though, minus the advice)&lt;br>
listening to everything from the manosphere, (no hatred towards them though)&lt;br>
and thinking therapy is a sad excuse. (even though people have used their trauma as an excuse and not use that knowledge for healing themselves but demand good treatment and no responsibilities from others, and thus make a mockery out of it.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but i&amp;rsquo;m no saint, i&amp;rsquo;m no preacher.&lt;br>
i have my faults.&lt;br>
i am working through it, yet i keep my hope in the Lord.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>what my mentor told me about relationships... and then i derail.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/what-my-mentor-told-me-about-relationships./</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/what-my-mentor-told-me-about-relationships./</guid><description>&lt;p>a relationship truly begins when both the man and the woman are completely unburdened and healed and &lt;em>then&lt;/em> choose each other with all their heart.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>what we like, what we don&amp;rsquo;t, what we&amp;rsquo;re scared of - all can be affected by what our parts in us think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>perhaps what we find beautiful and attractive right now, in our burdened states, is not what we&amp;rsquo;d really like if we were guided by the Self.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a relationship has its struggles, and issues that arise from our inner burdens and our hurt parts. but merely telling each other we&amp;rsquo;re worth it and the like will not solve the problem. or merely fighting over it or blaming each other will not solve the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>being kind and compassionate to ourselves and each other, and slowly healing ourselves is the way. and then when we are completely healed, we understand what we really want, and we choose each other - or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and this requires a lot of patience as well.&lt;br>
as you get to know a person more and more,&lt;br>
as the novelty fades away,&lt;br>
the scars become evident.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>sure, all this sounds simple. but it&amp;rsquo;s not easy.&lt;br>
i too have run away from myself, buried my anguishes, hurt myself, filled myself with rage, told myself it&amp;rsquo;s normal, it is what it is, lashed out at myself, blamed others - but it takes a lot to confront yourselves and admit to yourselves about what you&amp;rsquo;ve done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but don&amp;rsquo;t blame yourself.&lt;br>
the destructive things you might have done, it&amp;rsquo;s not because you&amp;rsquo;re evil. your parts who have a limited worldview and vision thought it&amp;rsquo;s best for you. they&amp;rsquo;re trying to help you out. acknowledge them, thank them for what they do to us. and ask them why they do so. listen to them open up. and lovingly tell them it&amp;rsquo;s not the way to do things, and let them heal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>again, easier said than done.&lt;br>
it takes a lot of courage.&lt;br>
and a whole lot of compassion.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>well, i don&amp;rsquo;t expect anyone to understand all this in one go.&lt;br>
it took me two years just to unlearn what i had learnt and learn the fundamentals. i used to think strength was all about muscles and possessions and money and being cocky and rude. i used to watch &amp;ldquo;reject modernity, embrace masculinity&amp;rdquo; videos all the time - again, no hate to anyone, but hating on others and worshipping superficial versions of &amp;ldquo;masculinity&amp;rdquo; like fictional superheroes and steroid junkies is not strength.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>i am no saint.&lt;br>
i have done things i&amp;rsquo;m not proud of.&lt;br>
i could tell myself i would have done things differently&lt;br>
if i were given a second chance,&lt;br>
but, i don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;br>
but i do have hope.&lt;br>
and i do feel His mercy, even though at times i seem to forget about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>my wayland situation.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/wayland/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/wayland/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="heading" id="pros-of-wayland-for-me">

&lt;p>but well, with DHH&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://omarchy.org/">omarchy&lt;/a> and pewdiepie&amp;rsquo;s hyprland setup,&lt;br>
among with many other rices,&lt;br>
let&amp;rsquo;s say it got me intrigued.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>to be honest, i do not care much about the rest,&lt;br>
but I remember seeing a hyprland rice with custom window decorations,&lt;br>
and that was actually wonderful.&lt;br>
i have tried to create a window decoration for KDE plasma,&lt;br>
but it turned out to be quite inflexible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and quickshell seems pretty interesting,&lt;br>
even though i could use it with KDE plasma, if i wanted to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but yeah.&lt;br>
i thought about giving it a try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>by the way, the title is a based on a lie -&lt;br>
i messed around with hyprland for like 20 minutes or so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>at first, it was okay.&lt;br>
the config file is pretty straightforward.&lt;br>
&lt;code>alt + enter&lt;/code> opens konsole, (konsole is pretty good)&lt;br>
&lt;code>alt + w&lt;/code> opens dolphin,&lt;br>
&lt;code>alt + q&lt;/code> closes the active window.&lt;br>
yeah, pretty easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i swap my control and capslock keys,&lt;br>
and being able to configure it within the hyprland config was pretty nice.&lt;br>
if it were a typical xorg window manager, i&amp;rsquo;d have to do something else.&lt;br>
well, one less config file to store.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i didn&amp;rsquo;t immediately dive into the bling parts.&lt;br>
i thought it can wait for later.&lt;br>
plus, i don&amp;rsquo;t feel like spending too much time customizing everything, so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but then i noticed that my laptop monitor was on.&lt;br>
(i have an external monitor plugged in.)&lt;br>
so i disabled the laptop screen in the config, and yeah, good.&lt;br>
i never expected it to work, but i thought,&lt;br>
well, maybe the hyprland guys programmed it so that&lt;br>
if i disconnect the HDMI, the laptop would be back on.&lt;br>
or there would be some config that would enable it.&lt;br>
and, i was wrong, to nobody&amp;rsquo;s surprise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>well, i thought some simple configuration would exist,&lt;br>
and i looked it up.&lt;br>
i saw a bunch of hacks:&lt;br>
bash scripts, hyprctl, IPC stuff, systemd services,&lt;br>
and there was something called kanshi or something.&lt;br>
and i was like, nah, man&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>enter flashbacks.&lt;br>
bspwm/herbstluftwm config,&lt;br>
endless editing of rofi configs,&lt;br>
polybar breaking the whole Xorg session everytime it updates,&lt;br>
writing runit services by hand.&lt;br>
ah no.&lt;br>
i &lt;em>really, really&lt;/em> don&amp;rsquo;t wanna go there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>hyprland&amp;rsquo;s ram usage was like 1.2 gigs or something.&lt;br>
at least in my pc.&lt;br>
but if i were to add a panel, notification system,&lt;br>
scripts and all that,&lt;br>
i would end up with ram usage of KDE plasma,&lt;br>
which is like 1.6 gigs at idle.&lt;br>
and KDE plasma does so much more.&lt;br>
so it&amp;rsquo;s not worth an effort anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>one could say KDE plasma made me lazy?,&lt;br>
but i&amp;rsquo;d say KDE is as comfy as home.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TIL hardwrap.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/til-hardwrap/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/til-hardwrap/</guid><description>&lt;p>i have this writing style of&lt;br>
breaking stuff into lines.&lt;br>
i don&amp;rsquo;t do paragraphs.&lt;br>
i like it this way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but that means i have to run this after i complete writing something:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code class="language-vimscript" data-lang="vimscript">:%s:$: :g
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>that&amp;rsquo;s two spaces.&lt;br>
basically what it does is, add two spaces to the end of every line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i think markdown requires either two spaces,&lt;br>
or a backslash,&lt;br>
or a &lt;code>&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but today i came across this thing called &lt;strong>hardwraps&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>in your &lt;code>hugo.toml&lt;/code> file, add this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>[markup]
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> [markup.goldmark]
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> [markup.goldmark.renderer]
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> hardWraps = &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">true&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>and no need of hacks anymore.&lt;br>
i could just write in obsidian and hit &lt;code>:w&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"batman begins" - thoughts.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/batman-begins---thoughts./</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/batman-begins---thoughts./</guid><description>&lt;p>revisited &amp;ldquo;batman begins&amp;rdquo; after a years.&lt;br>
was a kid when i watched it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>even since the death of his parents,&lt;br>
young bruce puts the blame on himself.&lt;br>
the thought germinated in his mind as a kid,&lt;br>
and he clung onto it as he grew.&lt;br>
he still bears the guilt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and what he did was bury the guilt with anger.&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;my anger outweighs my guilt&amp;rdquo;, he says.&lt;br>
but ra&amp;rsquo;s al ghul tells him he&amp;rsquo;ll teach bruce to&lt;br>
overcome his guilt by confronting it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>well, the rest of what happens isn&amp;rsquo;t that noteworthy in my opinion,&lt;br>
cause ra&amp;rsquo;s just shifts the blame onto thomas wayne,&lt;br>
because he didn&amp;rsquo;t act.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>why i noticed this is because,&lt;br>
whenever we go through tough situations,&lt;br>
what we tend to do is we bury it.&lt;br>
we are told to &amp;ldquo;shrug it off&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;deal with it&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;quit being a sock&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br>
it&amp;rsquo;s something normal.&lt;br>
and we pretend like it&amp;rsquo;s nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>we know the scars haven&amp;rsquo;t healed,&lt;br>
and they still are there.&lt;br>
but we gotta keep moving.&lt;br>
everyone knows we should deal with it,&lt;br>
but we don&amp;rsquo;t know how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so we distract ourselves with stuff.&lt;br>
numb ourselves with media.&lt;br>
adopt questionable coping methods&lt;br>
that seem like it&amp;rsquo;s working,&lt;br>
but introduce more hurt in the long term.&lt;br>
we resort to anger and hatred.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>on the surface,&lt;br>
it seems like everything&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;br>
no problems at sight.&lt;br>
so we go on living our life.&lt;br>
until one day, a slight reminder in the form of a remark,&lt;br>
a bruising memory, an image -&lt;br>
and then it all comes crashing down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>in this fast-paced world,&lt;br>
no one can be left behind.&lt;br>
so we keep on running.&lt;br>
running to new goals.&lt;br>
and running away from ourselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but is running away and distracting yourself&lt;br>
the answer?&lt;br>
or is being compassionate to yourself,&lt;br>
owning up to your doings,&lt;br>
yet treating yourself kindly, without bashing yourself,&lt;br>
and befriending yourself&lt;br>
the way?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i&amp;rsquo;m no expert.&lt;br>
i too have problems following my own advice.&lt;br>
but i have renounced the old ways of being hard on myself.&lt;br>
compassion must start from ourselves.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"gender politics."</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/gender-politics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/gender-politics/</guid><description>&lt;p>NOTE:&lt;br>

&lt;p>my analysis might be wrong,&lt;br>
but as i engaged in online discourse,&lt;br>
i could see two types of people.&lt;br>
and as far as online discussions go,&lt;br>
the most vocal, heated and extreme viewpoints are shared.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>on the extreme left of the spectrum lies the&lt;br>
misandrists who call themselves &amp;lsquo;feminists&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br>
they&amp;rsquo;re a minority within the feminist community, but a loud one.&lt;br>
it seems as if they have had horrible experiences from men,&lt;br>
and so they express their hatred in different ways.&lt;br>
saying things like they don&amp;rsquo;t need men to have babies&lt;br>
cause of bone marrow something something.&lt;br>
and similar opinions.&lt;br>
(i don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be an expert in this field.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and on the other end lies the manosphere.&lt;br>
incels, MGTOW, the self-proclaimed &amp;ldquo;sigma males&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;alpha males&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br>
they too seem to have had bad experiences from some women.&lt;br>
and they too share extreme views.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but something i found weird yet interesting is,&lt;br>
as the both of them go to the most extremes,&lt;br>
their stances seem to converge.&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;why marry? marriage is a trap.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;be promiscuous.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;the other sex is evil, they don&amp;rsquo;t deserve respect.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t marry and don&amp;rsquo;t have children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>but this sort of narrowed and poisonous thinking&lt;br>
has crept into mainstream discourse, too,&lt;br>
mainly fueled by social media and channels like Jubilee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but let me tell you:&lt;br>
anyone who tries to turn men and women against each other&lt;br>
has ulterior motives.&lt;br>
when men and women can be turned against each other,&lt;br>
it&amp;rsquo;s easier to assort us into two factions,&lt;br>
and fill our minds with ideologies that suit their agenda.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i don&amp;rsquo;t mean to bash on any groups.&lt;br>
both the feminists and the manosphere state facts.&lt;br>
we live in a society where women are stuck in homes,&lt;br>
and are not allowed access to education.&lt;br>
but at the same time,&lt;br>
men have been framed as bad actors and disregarded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>there is no single truth.&lt;br>
all these exist in the same world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>men and women shouldn&amp;rsquo;t compete with each other.&lt;br>
men and women are made to complement each other.&lt;br>
from the unity of a man and woman comes something beautiful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>let us not allow our burdens and the hurt we endured&lt;br>
to dictate our life and relationships.&lt;br>
let us heal, and rise above it.&lt;br>
let us all be friends.&lt;br>
let&amp;rsquo;s work together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>the psalm of gratitude.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/the-psalm-of-gratitude/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/the-psalm-of-gratitude/</guid><description>&lt;p>everyday feels like a gift from the Lord.&lt;br>
my only qualm is, i do not make much use of it.&lt;br>
yet, every single day feels different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i thought they were joking when they said that&lt;br>
the love of the Lord is different every day.&lt;br>
now i experience it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He saves me from every trouble,&lt;br>
He feeds me,&lt;br>
He protects me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i used to clamor for help,&lt;br>
i used to ask God,&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;God help me, fix this issue of mine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
but i think i downgraded God to a mere miracle-worker,&lt;br>
who would press some buttons and&lt;br>
(trying not to say &amp;ldquo;bada bing bada boom&amp;rdquo;)&lt;br>
hey, issue resolved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but, what He actually did was&lt;br>
teach me the tools to fix the issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i cannot believe&lt;br>
how God can forgive and love me&lt;br>
despite me faltering multiple times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>that is not to say&lt;br>
i have this very perfect life.&lt;br>
i have my burdens,&lt;br>
and i have hurt others,&lt;br>
and i don&amp;rsquo;t mean to justify my actions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

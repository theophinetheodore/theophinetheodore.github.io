was a kid when i watched it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>even since the death of his parents,&lt;br>
young bruce puts the blame on himself.&lt;br>
the thought germinated in his mind as a kid,&lt;br>
and he clung onto it as he grew.&lt;br>
he still bears the guilt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and what he did was bury the guilt with anger.&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;my anger outweighs my guilt&amp;rdquo;, he says.&lt;br>
but ra&amp;rsquo;s al ghul tells him he&amp;rsquo;ll teach bruce to&lt;br>
overcome his guilt by confronting it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"gender politics."</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/gender-politics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/gender-politics/</guid><description>&lt;p>NOTE:&lt;br>
my intention is not to blindly criticize anyone.&lt;br>
we are all humans, the children of God,&lt;br>
and we are all made in the image and likeness of God.&lt;br>
we all deserve good in our lives,&lt;br>
yet we are tormented by our internal and external burdens.&lt;br>
but we should seek to heal ourselves,&lt;br>
and treat each other with compassion.&lt;br>
i believe it&amp;rsquo;s possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>my analysis might be wrong,&lt;br>
but as i engaged in online discourse,&lt;br>
i could see two types of people.&lt;br>
and as far as online discussions go,&lt;br>
the most vocal, heated and extreme viewpoints are shared.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>the psalm of gratitude.</title><link>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/the-psalm-of-gratitude/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/thoughts/the-psalm-of-gratitude/</guid><description>&lt;p>everyday feels like a gift from the Lord.&lt;br>
my only qualm is, i do not make much use of it.&lt;br>
yet, every single day feels different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i thought they were joking when they said that&lt;br>
the love of the Lord is different every day.&lt;br>
now i experience it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He saves me from every trouble,&lt;br>
He feeds me,&lt;br>
He protects me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i used to clamor for help,&lt;br>
i used to ask God,&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;God help me, fix this issue of mine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
but i think i downgraded God to a mere miracle-worker,&lt;br>
who would press some buttons and&lt;br>
(trying not to say &amp;ldquo;bada bing bada boom&amp;rdquo;)&lt;br>
hey, issue resolved.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

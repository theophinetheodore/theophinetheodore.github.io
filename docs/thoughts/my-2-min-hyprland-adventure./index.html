but well, with DHH’s omarchy and pewdiepie’s hyprland setup,
among with many other rices,
let’s say it got me intrigued.
to be honest, i do not care much about the rest,
but I remember seeing a hyprland rice with custom window decorations,
and that was actually wonderful.
i have tried to create a window decoration for KDE plasma,
but it turned out to be quite inflexible."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_us"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="thoughts"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2025-07-20T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2025-07-20T00:00:00+00:00"><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/combined.min.92c3bf7119b98cfdc79e93f36a451eb901d8bbbfed7d75814e6436cf6c9085dc.css media=all></head><body class=auto><div class=content><header><div class=header><h1 class=header-title><a href=https://theophinetheodore.github.io/>theophine savio theodore.</a></h1><div class=header-menu><p class=small><a href=/>/home</a></p><p class=small><a href=/thoughts>/thoughts</a></p><p class=small><a href=/thoughts/index.xml>/rss</a></p></div></div></header><main class=main><div><article><header class=single-intro-container><h1 class=single-title>my 2-min hyprland adventure.</h1><div class=single-subsummary><div><p class=single-date><time datetime=2025-07-20T00:00:00+00:00>July 20, 2025</time></p></div></div></header><div class=single-content><p>well, i have used hyprland and sway in the past for a few weeks, i guess.</p><p>but well, with DHH&rsquo;s <a href=https://omarchy.org/>omarchy</a> and pewdiepie&rsquo;s hyprland setup,<br>among with many other rices,<br>let&rsquo;s say it got me intrigued.</p><p>to be honest, i do not care much about the rest,<br>but I remember seeing a hyprland rice with custom window decorations,<br>and that was actually wonderful.<br>i have tried to create a window decoration for KDE plasma,<br>but it turned out to be quite inflexible.</p><p>and quickshell seems pretty interesting,<br>even though i could use it with KDE plasma, if i wanted to.</p><p>but yeah.<br>i thought about giving it a try.</p><p>by the way, the title is a based on a lie -<br>i messed around with hyprland for like 20 minutes or so.</p><p>at first, it was okay.<br>the config file is pretty straightforward.<br><code>alt + enter</code> opens konsole, (konsole is pretty good)<br><code>alt + w</code> opens dolphin,<br><code>alt + q</code> closes the active window.<br>yeah, pretty easy.</p><p>i swap my control and capslock keys,<br>and being able to configure it within the hyprland config was pretty nice.<br>if it were a typical xorg window manager, i&rsquo;d have to do something else.<br>well, one less config file to store.</p><p>i didn&rsquo;t immediately dive into the bling parts.<br>i thought it can wait for later.<br>plus, i don&rsquo;t feel like spending too much time customizing everything, so.</p><p>but then i noticed that my laptop monitor was on.<br>(i have an external monitor plugged in.)<br>so i disabled the laptop screen in the config, and yeah, good.<br>i never expected it to work, but i thought,<br>well, maybe the hyprland guys programmed it so that<br>if i disconnect the HDMI, the laptop would be back on.<br>or there would be some config that would enable it.<br>and, i was wrong, to nobody&rsquo;s surprise.</p><p>well, i thought some simple configuration would exist,<br>and i looked it up.<br>i saw a bunch of hacks:<br>bash scripts, hyprctl, IPC stuff, systemd services,<br>and there was something called kanshi or something.<br>and i was like, nah, man&mldr;</p><p>enter flashbacks.<br>bspwm/herbstluftwm config,<br>endless editing of rofi configs,<br>polybar breaking the whole Xorg session everytime it updates,<br>writing runit services by hand.<br>ah no.<br>i <em>really, really</em> don&rsquo;t wanna go there.</p><p>hyprland&rsquo;s ram usage was like 1.2 gigs or something.<br>at least in my pc.<br>but if i were to add a panel, notification system,<br>scripts and all that,<br>i would end up with ram usage of KDE plasma,<br>which is like 1.6 gigs at idle.<br>and KDE plasma does so much more.<br>so it&rsquo;s not worth an effort anyway.</p><p>one could say KDE plasma made me lazy?,<br>but i&rsquo;d say KDE is as comfy as home.</p></div></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/thoughts/til-hardwrap/>TIL hardwrap.</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/thoughts/silence./>silence.</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p>Powered by

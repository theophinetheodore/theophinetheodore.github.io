title: 'my 2-min hyprland adventure.'

well, i have used hyprland and sway in the past for a few weeks, i guess.

but well, with DHH's [omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) and pewdiepie's hyprland setup,
among with many other rices,
let's say it got me intrigued.

to be honest, i do not care much about the rest,
but I remember seeing a hyprland rice with custom window decorations,
and that was actually wonderful.
i have tried to create a window decoration for KDE plasma,
but it turned out to be quite inflexible.

and quickshell seems pretty interesting,
even though i could use it with KDE plasma, if i wanted to.

but yeah.
i thought about giving it a try.

by the way, the title is a based on a lie -
i messed around with hyprland for like 20 minutes or so.

at first, it was okay.
the config file is pretty straightforward.
`alt + enter` opens konsole, (konsole is pretty good)
`alt + w` opens dolphin,
`alt + q` closes the active window.
yeah, pretty easy.

i swap my control and capslock keys,
and being able to configure it within the hyprland config was pretty nice.
if it were a typical xorg window manager, i'd have to do something else.
well, one less config file to store.

i didn't immediately dive into the bling parts.
i thought it can wait for later.
plus, i don't feel like spending too much time customizing everything, so.

but then i noticed that my laptop monitor was on.
(i have an external monitor plugged in.)
so i disabled the laptop screen in the config, and yeah, good.
i never expected it to work, but i thought,
well, maybe the hyprland guys programmed it so that
if i disconnect the HDMI, the laptop would be back on.
or there would be some config that would enable it.
and, i was wrong, to nobody's surprise.

well, i thought some simple configuration would exist,
and i looked it up.
i saw a bunch of hacks:
bash scripts, hyprctl, IPC stuff, systemd services,
and there was something called kanshi or something.
and i was like, nah, man...

enter flashbacks.
bspwm/herbstluftwm config,
endless editing of rofi configs,
polybar breaking the whole Xorg session everytime it updates,
writing runit services by hand.
ah no.
i *really, really* don't wanna go there.

one could say KDE plasma made me lazy?,
but i'd say KDE is as comfy as home.

everyone tells you:
fight your laziness.
fight your lethargy.
fight your despair.
fight your rage.
fight your lack of focus.
fight everything you see as a threat.

but here's another approach: 
befriend your laziness.
befriend your lethargy.
befriend your despair.
befriend your rage.
befriend your lack of focus.
befriend everything you see as a threat.

your emotions are not irrational.
if you do something, it has been done for a reason.
rather than fight against yourself
and treat yourself like an enemy,
befriend yourself.
try to understand yourself.
listen to what your parts within you have to say.
soothe them, care for them.
thank them for what they do.
lovingly tell them it could be done better.
if they falter, help them get back up.
treat them with love and respect.

maybe some of you might be thinking:
what is this sissy horses***?

well, if me from 2022 reads this, i'm pretty sure he'd call this "gay".

but trust me, i have been there.

the egolifting, the abuse,
the rage-driven squats and bench presses, (often with poor form, i admit)
the burial of emotions in order to strengthen yourself, (that causes more problems)
reading "Can't Hurt Me" by David Goggins, (nice book though, minus the advice)
listening to everything from the manosphere, (no hatred towards them though)
and thinking therapy is a sad excuse. (even though people have used their trauma as an excuse and not use that knowledge for healing themselves but demand good treatment and no responsibilities from others, and thus make a mockery out of it.)

but i'm no saint, i'm no preacher.
i have my faults.
i am working through it, yet i keep my hope in the Lord.

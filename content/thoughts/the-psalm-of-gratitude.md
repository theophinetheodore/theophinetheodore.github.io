everyday feels like a gift from the Lord.
my only qualm is, i do not make much use of it.
yet, every single day feels different.

i thought they were joking when they said that
the love of the Lord is different every day.
now i experience it.

He saves me from every trouble,
He feeds me,
He protects me.

i used to clamor for help,
i used to ask God,
"God help me, fix this issue of mine."
but i think i downgraded God to a mere miracle-worker,
who would press some buttons and
(trying not to say "bada bing bada boom")
hey, issue resolved.

but, what He actually did was
teach me the tools to fix the issue.

i cannot believe
how God can forgive and love me
despite me faltering multiple times.

that is not to say
i have this very perfect life.
i have my burdens,
and i have hurt others,
and i don't mean to justify my actions.

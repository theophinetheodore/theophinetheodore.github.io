i was at my brother's place.
we were having food, chatting, joking about random things and stuff.
and then, all of a sudden, we all fell silent.

and that's when my brother's filipina wife said,
in the philippines, when a group of people
who were talking suddenly fall silent,
they say it's because an angel just passed by.

i think it's interesting.

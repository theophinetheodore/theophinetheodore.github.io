NOTE:  
my intention is not to blindly criticize anyone.  
we are all humans, the children of God,  
and we are all made in the image and likeness of God.  
we all deserve good in our lives,  
yet we are tormented by our internal and external burdens.  
but we should seek to heal ourselves,  
and treat each other with compassion.  
i believe it's possible.

my analysis might be wrong,  
but as i engaged in online discourse,  
i could see two types of people.  
and as far as online discussions go,  
the most vocal, heated and extreme viewpoints are shared.  
  
on the extreme left of the spectrum lies the  
misandrists who call themselves 'feminists'.  
they're a minority within the feminist community, but a loud one.  
it seems as if they have had horrible experiences from men,  
and so they express their hatred in different ways.  
saying things like they don't need men to have babies  
cause of bone marrow something something.  
and similar opinions.  
(i don't claim to be an expert in this field.)  
  
and on the other end lies the manosphere.  
incels, MGTOW, the self-proclaimed "sigma males" and "alpha males".  
they too seem to have had bad experiences from some women.  
and they too share extreme views.  
  
but something i found weird yet interesting is,  
as the both of them go to the most extremes,  
their stances seem to converge.  
"why marry? marriage is a trap."  
"be promiscuous."  
"the other sex is evil, they don't deserve respect."  
"don't marry and don't have children."

but this sort of narrowed and poisonous thinking  
has crept into mainstream discourse, too,  
mainly fueled by social media and channels like Jubilee.  
  
but let me tell you:  
anyone who tries to turn men and women against each other  
has ulterior motives.  
when men and women can be turned against each other,  
it's easier to assort us into two factions,  
and fill our minds with ideologies that suit their agenda.  
  
i don't mean to bash on any groups.  
both the feminists and the manosphere state facts.  
we live in a society where women are stuck in homes,  
and are not allowed access to education.  
but at the same time,  
men have been framed as bad actors and disregarded.  
  
there is no single truth.  
all these exist in the same world.  

men and women shouldn't compete with each other.  
men and women are made to complement each other.  
from the unity of a man and woman comes something beautiful.  
  
let us not allow our burdens and the hurt we endured  
to dictate our life and relationships.  
let us heal, and rise above it.  
let us all be friends.  
let's work together.
